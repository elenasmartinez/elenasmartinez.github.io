      -  Programmed (in Python) a computational model to measure blood-pressure change at junctions 
      -  Tested the model using a repository of 105 patient-specific vascular models using Simvascular to extract measurements, measuring blood pressure at a total of 194,764 junctions
      - 	Implemented our computational model to a 0D and 1D reduced-order model to calculate cardiovascular flow with greater accuracy than existing methods (Continued my SURF research)
